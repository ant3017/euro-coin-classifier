**Euro Coin Classifier**
========================


Introduction
------------------------
This **Euro Coin Classifier** is part of the [Euro Coin Detector][4] project that aims to locate and recognize euro coins from natural images and classify them according to their coin denomination and tell their values. 

The classifier is developed using *Artificial Intelligence* and *Machine Learning* technologies. The classifier uses many images of the euro coin series of each denomination to describe each euro coin type's attributes, such as their shape, size, color, patterns, etc. This is used to generalize the euro coins so later the classifier could be used to determine whether an arbitrary object is a certain denomination of euro coin.
